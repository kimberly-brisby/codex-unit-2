# Level 6 — Images & Alt Text

## Objective

Teach correct use of `img` with `alt` and when to use `figure`/`figcaption` for contextual captions.

## Benefits (SEO & accessibility)

- Meaningful `alt` text improves accessibility for screen reader users and enables image search engines to index images accurately.
- Using `figure`/`figcaption` provides context that can be used for rich previews and improves content clarity for both users and crawlers.

## Complete these tasks

- **Provide** a meaningful `alt` attribute for the example image, or mark it decorative with `alt=""`.
- **Wrap** images that need captions in `figure` and add a `figcaption`.

### Quick example

```html
<figure>
  <img src="photo.jpg" alt="Students working on a laptop in a classroom" />
  <figcaption>Students collaborating during a coding lesson</figcaption>
</figure>
```

## Hints (Socratic)

- What information should `alt` provide that a blind user needs?

## Element notes

- `<img>`: void element that should include `alt`.
- `alt`: text alternative; descriptive for informative images, empty `""` for decorative images.
- `<figure>`/`<figcaption>`: use for images that need captions or context.

## Usage tips

- Keep alt text concise and focused on the image's purpose; include essential data in nearby text for complex visuals.
